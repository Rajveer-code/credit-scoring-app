# NBCFDC Digital Lending Platform

## 🚀 AI-Powered Beneficiary Credit Scoring with Direct Digital Lending

A comprehensive Flask-based web application for NBCFDC (National Backward Classes Finance & Development Corporation) that implements AI/ML-based credit scoring with income verification for direct digital lending to backward class beneficiaries.

---

## 📋 Problem Statement

**Challenge:** Develop an AI/ML-based credit scoring model that:
1. Uses historical repayment behavior, loan utilization patterns, and repeat borrowing data
2. Integrates income level assessment using consumption-based metrics
3. Produces a Composite Beneficiary Credit Score
4. Enables Direct Digital Lending for low-risk, eligible beneficiaries

**Goals:**
- Ensure loans reach genuine, low-income beneficiaries with good repayment behavior
- Reduce processing time for repeat borrowers by 50% or more
- Enable same-day sanction for high-score beneficiaries

---

## ✨ Key Features

  - Repayment Behavior Score (weighted 60%)
  - Consumption Profile Score (weighted 40%)

  1. **Low Risk - High Need** (Green): Priority beneficiaries
  2. **Low Risk - Low Need** (Blue): Eligible with standard terms
  3. **High Risk - High Need** (Orange): Requires careful assessment
  4. **High Risk - Low Need** (Red): Higher monitoring needed
